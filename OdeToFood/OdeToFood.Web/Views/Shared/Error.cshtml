<!-- This HTML code is a simple, standalone error page, typically used in web applications to display a generic message when an error occurs. This kind of page is often shown when an unhandled exception occurs or when a specific error view is not defined for a particular type of error -->
<!-- In a production environment, you would typically have custom error pages that handle different types of errors (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) with more user-friendly messages and options -->
