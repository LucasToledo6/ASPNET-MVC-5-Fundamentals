<!-- This Razor code sets the default layout for all views to _Layout.cshtml, which is located in the ~/Views/Shared directory. -->
<!-- When a view containing this code is rendered, ASP.NET MVC checks the _ViewStart.cshtml file first 
     It applies the settings found there, which in this case means using _Layout.cshtml as the layout for the view
     The content of the view will be rendered where the layout file calls @@RenderBody() -->
