# ASP.NET MVC 5 Fundamentals

This is the application constructed in the "ASP.NET MVC 5 Fundamentals" course in PluralSight, presented by Scott Allen.

This course allowed me to get started in building applications with ASP.NET MVC. Briefly speaking, I managed to learn how to handle web requests using controllers in the MVC framework, how to render HTML using Razor views, how to publish applications, etc.

To be more specific, this web application consists in a website where you can register different kinds of restaurants, using their names and cuisine type. This application provides the four basic types of functionality: Create, Read, Update and Delete.

It's also essential to mention that this application also includes a relational database implementation, thanks to the Entity Framework. The database used is the Microsoft SQL Server.
